# psion

A prototype which I'm not ready to TL;DR.

> In American science fiction of the 1950s and 1960s, psionics was a proposed
  discipline that applied principles of engineering (especially electronics) to
  the study (and employment) of paranormal or psychic phenomena, such as
  extrasensory perception, telepathy and psychokinesis. [1]
