<img src="asset/logo.png" align="left" width="20%" height="20%" />

Psion is a simplistic Go based system automation tool, which embeds the

Inspired by [Goss][], designed to resemble [Kubernetes][].

> In American science fiction of the 1950s and 1960s, [Psionics][] was a proposed
  discipline that applied principles of engineering (especially electronics) to
  the study (and employment) of paranormal or psychic phenomena, such as
  extrasensory perception, telepathy and psychokinesis.
